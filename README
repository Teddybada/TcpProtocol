A basic simulation of a network protocol (TCP). 

The user sends a password over the network to the server. 

If the password is not correct, the server prompts the user to try again for only one more time.
If the password is correct, the server will allow the user to send any message. 
The server has to acknowledge each message that the user send. 
The message exchange will not stop until the user end the conversation by sending the message, 'Bye'. 

To test the program, first launch TCPServer.java class then launch TCPClient.java

You will then be prompted to enter the server's password.
You can then follow the instructions from the console.
